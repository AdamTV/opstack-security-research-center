# üîê OP Stack Security Research Dashboard

## Overview
This dashboard provides a comprehensive security testing environment for OP Stack research. It combines automated vulnerability detection, exploit testing, and real-time monitoring in a user-friendly interface.

## üéØ Button Functionality Guide

### **Blockchain Explorer Section**
- **Query Blocks**: Retrieves the latest block information from the local OP Stack node
- **List Txns**: Fetches recent transactions with detailed metadata

### **Network Monitoring Section**  
- **Health Check**: Performs comprehensive system health analysis including RPC status
- **Get Metrics**: Displays real-time network metrics, peer count, and system resources

### **Node Management Section**
- **Node Status**: Checks OP Stack node connectivity and chain information
- **Check Peers**: Analyzes network peer connections and topology

### **Security Testing Arsenal**
- **Run Slither Analysis**: 
  - Comprehensive static analysis of OP Stack contracts
  - Generates detailed vulnerability reports with severity ratings
  - Saves reports to `security-reports/` directory
  - Focuses on: reentrancy, access control, gas optimization, economic attacks

- **Deploy Test Contracts**: 
  - Deploys vulnerable contracts for testing
  - Sets up exploit scenarios in controlled environment

- **Run Security Tests**: 
  - Executes automated test suites across multiple frameworks
  - Includes Foundry and Hardhat test runners

- **Vulnerability Scan**: 
  - Quick vulnerability assessment using Slither
  - Highlights critical security issues

- **Test Exploits**: 
  - Runs proof-of-concept exploits against test contracts
  - Validates vulnerability findings

- **Bytecode Analysis**: 
  - Analyzes compiled contract bytecode
  - Checks for suspicious patterns and optimizations

### **Automated Vulnerability Detection**
- **Reentrancy Check**: Detects all types of reentrancy vulnerabilities
- **Overflow Detection**: Identifies integer overflow/underflow issues
- **Access Control**: Analyzes privilege escalation and authorization flaws
- **Gas Analysis**: Finds gas optimization opportunities and DoS vectors  
- **Frontrunning**: Detects MEV and timing-based vulnerabilities
- **Generate PoC**: Creates proof-of-concept templates for found vulnerabilities

### **Live System Metrics**
- **Refresh Metrics**: Updates real-time system status and network information
- Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds with current block height, gas prices, and system health

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### **Enhanced Slither Integration**
- Multi-format output (JSON + human-readable)
- Categorized vulnerability detection
- Automated report generation with timestamps
- Comprehensive coverage of OP Stack-specific patterns

### **Real-time Monitoring**
- RPC endpoint health checking
- Network peer analysis  
- System resource monitoring
- Security alert aggregation

### **Exploit Development Support**
- Pre-configured vulnerable contracts
- Automated PoC generation
- Test environment isolation
- Multi-framework support (Foundry + Hardhat)

## üìä Security Reports

Reports are automatically saved to `security-reports/` with timestamps:
- `slither_analysis_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.txt` - Human-readable report
- `slither_analysis_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.json` - Machine-readable data

## üöÄ Usage Tips

1. **Start with Vulnerability Scan** - Get an overview of security issues
2. **Use Specific Detectors** - Focus on particular vulnerability types  
3. **Generate PoCs** - Create exploits for found issues
4. **Test Exploits** - Validate findings in controlled environment
5. **Monitor Metrics** - Keep track of system health during testing

## üé® Interface Features

- **Real-time Terminal Output** - All command results displayed instantly
- **Auto-scrolling** - Terminal automatically scrolls to show latest output
- **Visual Status Indicators** - Color-coded status dots for service health
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Dark Theme** - Optimized for security research environments

The dashboard is now fully functional and ready for comprehensive OP Stack security research!
